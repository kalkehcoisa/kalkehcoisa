# 👋 Hi, I’m Jayme

**Senior Backend Engineer | Transitioning into Data Engineering → MLOps | Python, SQL, Snowflake**

I’m a senior backend engineer with a strong data-oriented background, currently transitioning into **Data Engineering** and, in the longer term, **MLOps**.

My work revolves around building **reliable backend systems**, APIs and data pipelines using Python ecosystems. I care deeply about clarity, maintainability and systems that behave well in real production environments — not just in slides or demos.

---

## 🧠 What I work with

- **Languages:** Python, SQL, Bash  
- **Backend:** Django, FastAPI, Flask  
- **Data:** Snowflake, ETL / ELT pipelines, analytical SQL, data modeling  
- **Infrastructure & Tooling:** Docker, Git, Linux  
- **APIs & Integration:** REST APIs, JSON-based services, internal integrations  
- **Architecture:** API-first systems, service-oriented design, automation, data-driven backends

## 📌 Selected Work

Here you’ll find a mix of backend services, data-related tooling and experiments.

Typical things I work on:
- Backend services with heavy data interaction
- Python + SQL pipelines for data processing and analytics
- REST APIs and internal services
- Automation scripts, CLI tools and operational utilities
- Proofs of concept around data platforms and data-centric architectures

Not everything is a polished showcase project. Some repositories reflect experimentation and learning in public, especially as I deepen my work with data platforms and pipelines.

## 🚧 Current Direction

- Deepening Data Engineering fundamentals  
- Advanced SQL and analytical patterns  
- Snowflake-based data workflows  
- Backend services designed to support data & ML workloads  
- Gradual move toward **MLOps**, with focus on production concerns rather than experimentation-only setups
